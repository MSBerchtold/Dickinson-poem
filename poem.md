# The Moon Is Distant From The Sea
## *Emily Elizabeth Dickinson*<br>

:moon::ocean:

    The moon is _distant_ from the sea,
    And yet with _amber_ hands
    She leads him, _docile_ as a boy
    Along appointed sands.

    He _never_ misses a degree;
    Obedient to her eye,
    He comes _just so far_ toward the town,
    _Just so_ far goes away.

    Oh, Signor, thine the _amber_ hand,
    And mine the _distant_ sea, --
    Obedient to the least command
    Thine eyes _impose_ on me.
