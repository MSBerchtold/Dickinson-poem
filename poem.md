# The Moon Is Distant From The Sea
## *Emily Elizabeth Dickinson*<br>

:moon::ocean:

    The moon is distant from the sea,
    And yet with amber hands
    She leads him, docile as a boy
    Along appointed sands.

    He never misses a degree;
    Obedient to her eye,
    He comes just so far toward the town,
    Just so far goes away.

    Oh, Signor, thine the amber hand,
    And mine the distant sea, --
    Obedient to the least command
    Thine eyes impose on me.
